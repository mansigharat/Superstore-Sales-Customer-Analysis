## Project Overview
This project analyzes sales and customer behavior for a Superstore dataset using **SQL** and **Python (pandas & matplotlib)**.  
The goal is to identify top-selling products, seasonal sales trends, high-value customers, and product-customer purchasing patterns, providing actionable business insights for marketing, inventory, and sales strategies.

## Tools & Technologies
- **SQL Server** – Data extraction and aggregation
- **Python** – Data analysis and visualization
  - pandas
